I
SHOULD
LIKE
TO
SAY
AT
ONCE
THAT
MY
PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
THE
HEAD
OF
S.I.S.
AND
HIS
CHIEF
OFFICER
(A.C.S.S.)
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
VERY
GOOD
INDEED,
AND
THROUGHOUT
THE
TWO
ORGANISATIONS
THERE
ARE
INSTANCES
WHERE
CORRESPONDING
SECTIONS
HAVE
MANAGED
TO
GET
ALONG
VERY
WELL
TOGETHER
-
BUT
GENERALLY
SPEAKING
I
HAVE
NOT
THE
SLIGHTEST
HESITATION
IN
STATING
QUITE
CATEGORICALLY
THAT
THE
GENERAL
KEY
WORD
FROM
TOP
TO
BOTTOM
IN
THE
S.I.S.
ORGANISATION
HAS
BEEN
TO
DELAY
RATHER
THAN
TO
EXPEDITE
THE
NATURAL
EXPANSION
OF
S.O.E.
